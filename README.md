# Lyft_Data
This is a demonstration of using JOIN functions within SQL and their importance.
Here, I created joined tables from multiple sources within Lyft's public database to do the following:
calculate average trip cost and the amount of active cars on the road,
create an email campaign for less frequent users,
and issue recall's on cars that have been on the road for too long.
